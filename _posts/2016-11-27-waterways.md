After finding a beautiful dataset by the Province of North Holland containing all canals 
and rivers I couldn't resist visualizing it. The visualization is not intended as a realistic
depiction (most of the canals are too small to be visible at this scale). Rather, I went for
an intriguing visual that reveals spatial patterns.
